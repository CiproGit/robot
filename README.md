# robot
In this program there is a robot in a square room. It starts from the initial position and must arrive to the destination.<br>
The program takes as input a positive integer value, representing the size of the room, then the robot moves (with a recursive call) one step at a time towards the goal.<br>
The movements are balanced between horizontal and vertical directions. The followed path is shown in the output.
